I'm happy to announce that I finally got around to putting together a bunch of piano songs into an album!
It needs some work, and I'm not entirely happy with it, but there has to be some point where you call it good enough.

It's on Bandcamp, and [this](https://steampunc.bandcamp.com/album/potentiality) is the link to it. Happy listening, if you do happen to try it out.
