title:  "Scraping Websites that Don't Want to Be Scraped"

excerpt: "Dynamically rendered webpages are a pain in the butt"
---

For one of my more [recent projects](http://steampunc.com/chord-tool/index.html), I needed to scrape a website containing a vast volume of user populated chord and song data. 

The website's owners understandably didn't want to be scraped because their business model is presumably based on the ad revenue coming in from visitors on their site, and if I were to extract their data and host it elsewhere it would likely lose them money (especially considering how aggressive the website is with their adverts). That wasn't my goal, however, and the safeguards they put in place to prevent scraping just gave me a lot of headaches.

Here, I'm talking through the different methods I tried before finally breaking through their defenses and making a _much_ more efficient scraper by exploiting a silly development decision.

#### Problems
1. No way to easily obtain the url of every song on the site (upwards of a million urls)<br>The unfortunate but necessary solution was to start by going through the list of artists (0-9, A, B, C, D, ...) and obtain the url to every artists's portfolio of songs, which I could then scrape for data.

2. The page is dynamically rendered with JavaScript<br>This is where the most time was lost in the initial designs of the scraper.

3. The website doesn't like getting DoSsed<br>I was making 10+ requests a second so something like fail2ban must have kicked in, because after about two hours of successful scraping, my IP was banned :| Thankfully, I found a solution.

#### Attempt 1: Curl and Python
First, I tried to scrape it as simply as possible. I identified the `<href>` elements that contained the urls I was interested in and by using curl, I downloaded a static page and tried to use python's `html.parser` to select all such elements.

Unfortunately, none of the body is populated until some script runs on the webpage, so it kept failing and I didn't get anywhere with this approach.

#### Attempt 2: Selenium
Shamefully, instead of looking for ways to break the page and bypass that script, my next idea was to use something like selenium to dynamically load the page and extract elements from that dynamically loaded page. 

This was a _horrible_ decision - not only was it slow, but I was trying to run multiple "threads" by making them background processes, and the CPU usage with this method frequently used the majority of my 8 cores. On the plus side, I made too few requests for any kind of DoS prevention software to kick in!


#### Attempt 3: Curl and Python... Again!
At this point I asked a [friend](https://minor.gripe/) at the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) what observations he might have about the problem, and lo, my problem with dynamically loading the site was suddenly solved! 

He pointed out that if you look at the page you obtain with curl, it turns out to contain a peculiar script with nothing but an _enormous_ (40,000 character!) JSON object:

This object turned out to contain _ALL_ the contents of the page, ready for the other scripts to take the content and use it to populate the page itself! This discovery rapidly sped up my scraping and I was able to retake my scraper from the beginning, add some bodged-on functionality for multithreading (using a filesystem to syncronize multiple independent python processes, rather than actually have them communicate with something like mutexes and all that stuff), and make it scrape about 10+ pages per second!

10+ pages per second! This was a great step up from my previous attempt which averaged ~2 every second.

The final problem to work around was that after about an hour of repeated requests, they blocked my IP. Drat. All that euphoria of finally having a functional and moderately efficient scraper, and now this.

The solution was to employ a CLI-based VPP which Windscribe offers, and have a script that restarted the VPN every ten minutes or so. Perhaps this wasn't the best solution, but it worked for my purposes and I only had to use it for about a day.

You can check out the app that the scraping facilitated [here](http://steampunc.com/chord-tool/index.html), and a blog post that demonstrates how it works [here](I haven't done this yet). I'm not posting the code itself, because other scrapers of this website have been removed in the past, but for anyone looking to do something similar, I hope this was mildly informative!
