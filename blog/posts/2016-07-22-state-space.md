excerpt: "I wrote this to get myself a better understanding of state space modeling and controllers! Worked pretty well"

This was a really good learning experience for me, as I think it solidified my understanding of a lot of subjects that I was previously confused about. I know for a fact there are mathematical errors and several concepts that I breezed over without explaining, but that's because I'm still learning them myself. Just as a side note, if you're ever not understanding something and you want to learn it better, write some documentation or a paper about it! It's a great way to see what you don't have a good grasp of.
