excerpt: "What do we care about?"
---

Hey! Been a while since I wrote something - sorry about that. Things have been very busy and changing, what with college and new developments in my life.

As a part of growing older and starting to think for myself, I've been questioning what I value and trying to create a more coherent hierarchy for my beliefs. It's very difficult for myself to do because I tend to forget things, so I decided to write this program to try and "rank" my values. It's some pretty simple python3 program (not very well written because I wasn't thinking very hard while writing it), but it does the job. You can take a look at it on my [GitHub](https://github.com/steampunc/toy-box/tree/master/value-plotter).


Enjoy!
